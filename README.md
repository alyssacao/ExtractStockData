# Stock Data Extraction and Visualization
This project is part of the IBM Data Analyst Course, specifically the "Python Basics for Data Science" subtopic. The project demonstrates how to extract stock data using Python and visualize it using graphs. It includes tasks such as fetching financial data through the yfinance library and using web scraping techniques to gather revenue data for different companies.

## Tasks
- Extract Stock Data using yfinance: Retrieve historical stock data for a specific company (e.g., Tesla) using the yfinance library.

- Web Scraping for Tesla Revenue Data: Use web scraping techniques to gather Tesla's revenue data from a website.

- Extract Stock Data using yfinance: Retrieve historical stock data for another company (e.g., GameStop) using yfinance.

- Web Scraping for GameStop Revenue Data: Use web scraping to gather revenue data for GameStop from an online source.

- Plot Tesla Stock Graph: Use matplotlib or seaborn to plot the historical stock data of Tesla, visualizing the stock performance.

- Plot GameStop Stock Graph: Similarly, plot the historical stock data of GameStop, visualizing the stock trends.

## Requirements
yfinance (for stock data extraction)  
beautifulsoup4 (for web scraping)  
plotly (for interactive plotting)  
pandas (for data manipulation)  
## Description
This project focuses on extracting stock and revenue data for Tesla and GameStop using Python. It includes visualizing the stock trends by plotting graphs. While there is no in-depth analysis in this project, it serves as an introduction to financial data extraction and visualization using Python libraries.

### Note:
Since the graph is not displayed here, I have attached the image file in the project directory under the `graphs` folder.
